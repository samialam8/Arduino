**A Buzz Wire Game** (steady-hand game) is simple, educational, and perfect for building with an Arduino Uno

***Components Required***

1 × Arduino Uno

1 × Buzzer (active buzzer preferred)

1 × LED (any color)

1 × 220Ω resistor (for LED)

1 × Long stiff wire (to bend into a shape)

1 × Metal loop (handle – can use thick wire)

1 × Common Cathode 7-segment display

7 × 220Ω resistors (for segments a–g)

Jumper wires

Breadboard

Cardboard or wooden base

9V battery or USB power

**Pin Mapping**
| Item        | Arduino Pin |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Maze wire   | GND         |
| Handle loop | Pin 2       |

| Item     | Arduino Pin |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Buzzer + | Pin 8       |
| Buzzer – | GND         |

| Item  | Arduino Pin          |
| ----- | -------------------- |
| LED + | Pin 9 (through 220Ω) |
| LED – | GND                  |
**7-Segment (Common Cathode)**
| Segment | Arduino Pin |
| ------- | ----------- |
| a       | 3           |
| b       | 4           |
| c       | 5           |
| d       | 6           |
| e       | 7           |
| f       | 10          |
| g       | 11          |
Common cathode → GND

Each segment must go through a 220Ω resistor.
